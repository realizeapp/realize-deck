## Vision

## A world where everyone is fully in control of themselves.

---

## Everyone wants to improve their health and avoid hospital stays.  They often just don't know how.

### Patients lack:

* *Timely information.*  The process for discovering that you have an illness often involves experiencing a symptom and looking it up online.
* *Quick connections to caregivers.*  Healthcare organizations are currently unable to influence patient behavior when they aren't in the office.
* *Personalized insight.* Recovery is usually one-size-fits all, and can't adapt to the individual.

---

## How do we solve this?

* *Trend:* Patients increasingly use wearable devices to track their health
* *Trend:* Hospitals are increasingly incentivized to favor preventative and lower-cost care
* *Solution:* Leverage patient health data to increase engagement and make care more effective

---

## Product

* *Easy-to-use dashboard.*  Lets patients see their data at a glance
* *Powerful administrative tools.*  Makes it easy for hospitals and clinics to manage patients
* *Plugin architecture.*  Lets developers write plugins that pull in data from trackers, analyze it, and display it to the user
