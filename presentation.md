# Realize
## Use data to improve your health.

---

## Vision

## A world where everyone is fully in control of themselves.

---

## Problem

## Everyone wants to improve their health and avoid hospital stays.  They often just don't know how.

### They lack:

* Timely information.  The process for discovering that you have an illness often involves experiencing a symptom and looking it up online.
* Quick connections to caregivers.  Preventative care can improve well-being and reduce costs when well-executed.
* Personalized improvement plans. Recovery advice is usually one-size-fits all, and can't adapt to the individual.

---

## Solution

* Patients increasingly use wearable devices to track their health
* Preventative care improves patient well-being and hospitals are increasingly incentivized to favor it
* Leverage patient health tracking data to figure out when preventative care should happen, and then connect them with doctors

---

* Help patients by providing timely analysis and insight
